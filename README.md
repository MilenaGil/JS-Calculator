# JavaScript-Calculator
A simple calculator application built using JavaScript. More updates soon, work in progress...

This is a beginner-friendly JavaScript project that demonstrates how to create a basic calculator from scratch.
Itâ€™s a great way to learn about DOM manipulation, localStorage and JavaScript logic.

The project is contained in a file with the .html extension.
